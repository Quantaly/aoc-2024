My solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), written in Rust.

These are not necessarily the most optimal solutions or highest-quality code; they are just what I could come up with. Additionally, I don't expect to be able to make it through the whole month without some fairly substantial hints.

I am doing this for the sake of learning, not for the sake of showing off. I'm posting my code mostly to compare solutions with my friends.

Please do not open issues or pull requests.
